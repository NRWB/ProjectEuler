# ProjectEuler
Problem solving for ProjectEuler.net

## About
A repository (repo) for code pertaining to problems from the ProjectEuler.net website. Known about the site, ProjectEuler.net for quite some time, even made repo's for it before and deleted them for whatever reason. This project is solely for the purpose of studying, learning, and education.

## Project File Structure
How this repo is designed/laid out in terms of file structure.
```
/problem/<id-number>/
/problem/<id-number>/question.txt
/problem/<id-number>/<related-files>.*
```
and
```
/solution/<id-number>/<programming-language>/
/solution/<id-number>/<programming-language>/<source-file(s)>.*
/solution/<id-number>/<programming-language>/output/log.txt
```

Regarding problems/solutions that require repetitive code for similar problems - these will be cleaned up at undefined intervals, namely when repetition becomes cumbersome and creates code-clutter. Otherwise copy-pasta code will remain in place for the sake of efficient nature in the process.

## Learning
All problems are attempted with individual knowledge. In the likely case that a problem is required to search the internet for assistance in any way, links will be cited in either code or a separate file to note assistance. This includes readings, code, articles, pre-existing solutions (hopefully not too many of these!), etc.
